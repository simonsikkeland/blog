**So around black friday last year I decided to build my own computer for Machine Learning, programming projects and some casual gaming.**

Since the whole world had the same plan as me, the parts especialy graphic cards and powersuply was, and still am, overpriced. To get my Nvidia GTX 1070 I had to go to the second hand market, it cost me 200$. Not to bad all things consider. The plan is to upgrade this when the market slows down, which may take years sadly. 

I bought my CPU from a friend, a AMD Rysen 2700X, for 50 bucks.
 
Complete list of parts:
	32 GB G.Skill DDR4-3200 C16 RAM         Price: 1399kr
    ASUS B550-F motherboard                 Price: 1699kr
    GIGABYTE AORUS P850W PSU                Price: 1399kr
    Fractal Define C                        Price: 899kr
    Noctua NH-U12S black edition            Price: 749kr
    Corsair MP600 1TB M.2 SSD               Price: 2190kr
    NVIDIA GTX 1070                         Price: 2000kr
    AMD Rysen 2700X                         Price: 500kr
    
All in all it cost me 10835kr, by todays rate 1279$. 

I now have dualboot with Linux for coding and windows for gaming.  
Currently im testing out the Arch distribution.
