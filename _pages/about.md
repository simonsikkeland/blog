Hi,

My name is Simon and I am a 29 year old curious human being from Oslo, Norway. This page is my tinkering place where I will explore different technologies, programming projects and other projects in life.

My interests are many; machine learning, programming, skiing, mountain hiking, music, movies, gaming and more.

Yeah, and the German Shepherd is my friend Luna, she is wearing socks in the snow.
